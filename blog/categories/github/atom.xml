    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been contributing to many open source projects over the past couple of years and I found <a href="https://github.com/jaceklaskowski">GitHub</a> pleasantly helpful to continue the gig in the years to come. I&rsquo;ve learnt few techniques along the way.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to keep the techniques for myself so the git/GitHub cheat sheet is supposed to help me remember the commands and others to learn from my mistakes (<em>aka</em> experience). It&rsquo;s so easy on GitHub that I keep wondering why it took me so long to learn it. It must not for you.</p>

<p>Have fun contributing to open source projects as much as I do! <em>Pro publico bono.</em></p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> It becomes feature-complete when the note disappears. Live with the few mistakes for now. Let me know what you think in the Comments section. Pull requests are welcome, too. Thanks!</p>

<h2>Picking project</h2>

<p>You start your day hunting down the project you want to contribute to. Be adventurous and pick the one you&rsquo;ve always been dreaming about. This might be the day when the dream comes true.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more into Scala/sbt lately so I&rsquo;m with projects under control of the project build tool &ndash; <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a> as I can learn both contributing.</p>

<h2>Cloning project</h2>

<p>Learning a project can take different approaches and reading the source code or just building it and staying on the cutting edge are a few examples.</p>

<p>In the project&rsquo;s repository on GitHub, on the right-hand side, there&rsquo;s this clone URL field. Select the protocol to use (HTTPS or SSH) and click the Copy to clipboard button.</p>

<p>In the terminal, execute the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git clone [clone URL]
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a directory with the project. The sources are yours now, master.</p>

<h2>Forking project</h2>

<p>Your very first step is to fork a project. Forking means creating your own copy of the project. On GitHub it&rsquo;s so easy with the Fork button in the upper-right corner. Click it and select the account you want the fork go.</p>

<p>In the terminal, go to the project&rsquo;s directory and add the repository as a remote repository.</p>

<pre><code>git remote add [remote-name] [clone URL]
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to use my first name for <code>remote-name</code> so I know that my personal repository copy is under <code>jacek</code> nick.</p>

<h2>Branching project</h2>

<p>Developing a change for a project is the real thing. It can be a documentation page, a fix for an issue or whatever else the project holds.</p>

<p>The following command</p>

<pre><code>git checkout -b [branch-name]
</code></pre>

<p>creates and changes your current branch from <code>master</code> (usually) to <code>branch-name</code>. Use <code>wip/</code> in the <code>branch-name</code> to denote that the work is in progress so people can review the changes before they get <em>squashed</em> and merged with the master.</p>

<h2>Committing changes to project</h2>

<p>On a branch, go the following to commit the changes of yours:</p>

<pre><code>git commit -m [commit-message] -a
</code></pre>

<p>There are some strict rules on how to write a proper <code>commit-message</code>. For now, don&rsquo;t worry about it too much. There are tougher things you will have to go through and writing proper commit messages don&rsquo;t belong to that category&hellip;yet. It&rsquo;s more important to get you up to speed with contributing to a project than to do it without mistakes from the day 0.</p>

<h2>Pushing changes to remote repo</h2>

<p>With the changes on the branch committed, it&rsquo;s time to show off on GitHub. Push the changes with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>git push [remote-name] [branch-name]
</code></pre>

<p>Using command completion can save you a lot of typing here. A decent shell like <a href="http://ohmyz.sh/">oh-my-zsh</a> is highly recommended (on Mac OS X at the very least).</p>

<p><code>remote-name</code> is the nick of the remote repository, e.g. <code>jacek</code> while <code>branch-name</code> is the name of the branch you&rsquo;re working on right now.</p>

<h2>Creating pull request on GitHub</h2>

<p>With the changes in the remote repository on GitHub, you should now be able to send a pull request to the original repo.</p>

<p>GitHub shows the Pull Request button when you&rsquo;re changes hit your repository that&rsquo;s a fork of the project. Click the button and fill out the blanks. GitHub uses your commit message as the title that further easies the process.</p>

<p>Click Create and you&rsquo;ve just contributed to the project! Open Source Contributor badge unlocked! Congratulations.</p>

<h2>Squashing changes</h2>

<p>There might be times when your work in progress generates a stream of changes to the branch. You may face a request <em>to squash the changes</em> so it goes (aka gets merged) to the master as a single change/commit.</p>

<p>Use <code>git rebase -i</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git rebase -i master
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>master</code> is the name of the master branch of the project you forked and then branched for your changes.</p>

<p>Fix any merge issues while rebasing. When fixed, <code>git add</code> the files and <code>git rebase --continue</code> afterwards.</p>

<p>You can always go back to the previous state (before squashing) with <code>git rebase --abort</code>.</p>

<p>Doing squashing is worth the time since merging the changes with the master later on becomes a no-brainer for the project maintainers.</p>

<p>You may also want to read the article <a href="http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html">squashing commits with rebase</a> that has helped me a lot to get the gist of rebasing under git.</p>

<h2>Deleting remote and local branches</h2>

<p>When the work is over and all the changes are merged with the master, you can safely delete remote and local branches.</p>

<p>Once the work gets merged, GitHub asks you to delete the branch. Click the button under the pull request.</p>

<p>Delete the local branch with the command:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -D [branch-name]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>branch-name</code> is the name of the branch you want to delete.</p>

<p>You should change the branch to some other branch to be able to delete it.</p>
