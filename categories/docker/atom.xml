[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) has always been high on my list of things to explore, but since there are quite a few things high on my list, Kafka couldn't actually make it to the very top. Until just recently, when I was asked to give **the broker** a try and see whether or not it meets a project's needs. Two projects, to be honest. You should see my face when I heard it.

[I compiled Apache Kafka from the sources](https://github.com/apache/kafka#apache-kafka), connected it to [Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/) and even attempted to answer few questions on StackOverflow ([How to use Kafka in Flink using Scala?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/31391782/1305344) and [How to monitor Kafka broker using jmxtrans?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/31344222/1305344)), not to mention reading tons of articles and watching videos about the tool. I developed pretty strong confidence what use cases are the sweet spot for Apache Kafka.

With the team in [Codilime](http://www.codilime.com/) I'm developing [DeepSense.io](http://deepsense.io/) platform where we have just used [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) to automate deployment. We've also been evaluating [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and/or [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). All to ease the deployment of DeepSense.io.

That's the moment when these two needs converged - exploring Apache Kafka and Docker (among the other tools) for three separate projects! Amazing, isn't it? I could finally explore how Docker might ease exploration of products and deployment. I knew Docker could ease my developer life, but it's only now when I really saw it. I would now *dockerize* everything. When I was told about the images [wurstmeister/kafka](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wurstmeister/kafka/) and [wurstmeister/zookeeper](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wurstmeister/zookeeper/) I couldn't have been happier. Running Apache Kafka and using Docker finally became a no-brainer and such a pleasant experience.

I then thought I'd share the love so it's not only mine and others could benefit from it, too.

Since I'm on **Mac OS X** the steps to run Apache Kafka using Docker rely on [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) - *a Lightweight Linux for Docker* for platforms that don't natively support Docker - aforementioned Mac OS X and Windows.

You're going to use the images [wurstmeister/kafka](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wurstmeister/kafka/) and [wurstmeister/zookeeper](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wurstmeister/zookeeper/).

You can run containers off the images in background or foreground. Depending on you Unix skills, it means one or two terminals. Let's use two terminals for each server - Apache Kafka and Apache Zookeeper. I'm going to explain the role of Apache Zookeeper in another blog post.

Here come the steps to run Apache Kafka using Docker. It's assumed you've got `boot2docker` and `docker` tools installed.

    ➜  ~  boot2docker version
    Boot2Docker-cli version: v1.7.1
    Git commit: 8fdc6f5

    ➜  ~  docker --version
    Docker version 1.7.1, build 786b29d

I'm a big fan of [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and highly recommend it to anyone using Mac OS X. Plenty of ready-to-use packages are just `brew install` away, docker and boot2docker including.

## Running Kafka on two Docker images

1. (Mac OS X and Windows users only) Execute `boot2docker up` to start the tiny Linux core on Mac OS.

        ➜  ~  boot2docker up
        Waiting for VM and Docker daemon to start...
        .o
        Started.
        Writing /Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/ca.pem
        Writing /Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/cert.pem
        Writing /Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/key.pem

        To connect the Docker client to the Docker daemon, please set:
            export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.104:2376
            export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
            export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1

1. (Mac OS X and Windows users only) Execute `$(boot2docker shellinit)` to have the terminal set up and let `docker` know where the tiny Linux core is running (via `boot2docker`). You have to do the step in any terminal you open to work with Docker so the `export`s above are set. Should you face communication issues with `docker` commands, remember the step.

       ➜  ~  $(boot2docker shellinit)
       Writing /Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/ca.pem
       Writing /Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/cert.pem
       Writing /Users/jacek/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm/key.pem

1. Run `docker ps` to verify the terminal is configured properly for Docker.

       ➜  ~  docker ps
       CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

    No containers are running at this time. It's going to change soon once you start the containers for Zookeeper first and then Kafka.

1. [Create an account on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/jaceklaskowski/) and execute `docker login` to store the credentials. With the step you don't have to repeat them for `docker pull` to pull images off the public hub of Docker images. Think of the Docker Hub as the GitHub for Docker images. Refer to the documentation [Using the Docker Hub](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/userguide/) for more up-to-date information.

1. Run `docker pull wurstmeister/zookeeper` to pull the Zookeeper image off Docker Hub (might take a few minutes to download):

       ➜  ~  docker pull wurstmeister/zookeeper
       Pulling repository wurstmeister/zookeeper
       a3075a3d32da: Download complete
       ...
       840840289a0d: Download complete
       e7381f1a45cf: Download complete
       5a6fc057f418: Download complete
       Status: Downloaded newer image for wurstmeister/zookeeper:latest

   You will see hashes of respective layers printed out to the console. It's expected.

1. Execute `docker pull wurstmeister/kafka` to pull the Kafka image off Docker Hub (might take a few minutes to download):

        ➜  ~  docker pull wurstmeister/kafka
        latest: Pulling from wurstmeister/kafka
        428b411c28f0: Pull complete
        ...
        422705fe88c8: Pull complete
        02bb7ca441d8: Pull complete
        0f9a08061516: Pull complete
        24fc32f98556: Already exists
        Digest: sha256:06150c136dcfe6e4fbbf37731a2119ea17a953c75902e52775b5511b3572aa1f
        Status: Downloaded newer image for wurstmeister/kafka:latest

1. Verify that the two images - `wurstmeister/kafka` and `wurstmeister/zookeeper` - are downloaded. From the command line execute `docker images`:

       ➜  ~  docker images
       REPOSITORY               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
       wurstmeister/kafka       latest              24fc32f98556        3 weeks ago         477.6 MB
       wurstmeister/zookeeper   latest              a3075a3d32da        9 months ago        451 MB

1. You can now execute `docker run --name zookeeper -p 2181 -t wurstmeister/zookeeper` in one terminal to boot Zookeeper up.

    Remember `$(boot2docker shellinit)` if you're on Mac OS X or Windows.

        ➜  ~  docker run --name zookeeper -p 2181:2181 -t wurstmeister/zookeeper
        JMX enabled by default
        Using config: /opt/zookeeper-3.4.6/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
        2015-07-17 19:10:40,419 [myid:] - INFO  [main:QuorumPeerConfig@103] - Reading configuration from: /opt/zookeeper-3.4.6/bin/../conf/zoo.cfg
        ...
        2015-07-17 19:10:40,452 [myid:] - INFO  [main:ZooKeeperServer@773] - maxSessionTimeout set to -1
        2015-07-17 19:10:40,464 [myid:] - INFO  [main:NIOServerCnxnFactory@94] - binding to port 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181

    This gives you Zookeeper listening to port 2181. Check it out by telneting to it using docker (or boot2docker on MacOS) ip address.

        ➜  ~  telnet `boot2docker ip` 2181
        Trying 192.168.59.103...
        Connected to 192.168.59.103.
        Escape character is '^]'.

1. Execute `docker run --name kafka -e HOST_IP=localhost -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 -e KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1 -e ZK=zk -p 9092 --link zookeeper:zk -t wurstmeister/kafka` in another terminal.

    Remember `$(boot2docker shellinit)` if you're on Mac OS X or Windows.

        ➜  ~  docker run --name kafka -e HOST_IP=localhost -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 -e KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1 -e ZK=zk -p 9092 --link zookeeper:zk -t wurstmeister/kafka

    You're now a happy user of Apache Kafka on your computer using Docker. Check the status of the containers using `docker ps`:

        ➜  ~  docker ps
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                 NAMES
        0b34a9927004        wurstmeister/kafka       "/bin/sh -c start-ka   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:32769->9092/tcp                               kafka
        14fd32558b1c        wurstmeister/zookeeper   "/bin/sh -c '/usr/sb   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes        22/tcp, 2888/tcp, 3888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32768->2181/tcp   zookeeper

1. Once you're done with your journey into Apache Kafka, `docker stop` the containers using `docker stop kafka zookeeper` (or `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)` if the only running containers are `kafka` and `zookeeper`).

        ➜  ~  docker stop kafka zookeeper
        kafka
        zookeeper

    Running `docker ps` shows no running containers afterwards:

        ➜  ~  docker ps
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

    There are no running containers since they're stopped now. They are still ready to be booted up again - use `docker ps -a` to see the ready-to-use containers:

        ➜  ~  docker ps -a
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
        7dde25ff7ec2        wurstmeister/kafka       "/bin/sh -c start-ka   15 hours ago        Exited (137) 16 seconds ago                       kafka
        b7b4b675b9c0        wurstmeister/zookeeper   "/bin/sh -c '/usr/sb   16 hours ago        Exited (137) 5 seconds ago                        zookeeper

1. (Mac OS X and Windows users only) Finally, stop `boot2docker` daemon using `boot2docker down`.

## Summary

With these two docker images - [wurstmeister/kafka](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wurstmeister/kafka/) and [wurstmeister/zookeeper](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/wurstmeister/zookeeper/) - you can run **Apache Kafka** without much changing your local workstation to install it together with the necessary components like Apache ZooKeeper. You don't need to worry about upgrading the software and its dependencies except docker itself (and boot2docker if you're lucky to be on Mac OS). That saves you from spending time on installation and ensures proper functioning of your machine and the software. Moreover, the Docker images could be deployed to other machines and guarantee a consistent environment of the software inside.
